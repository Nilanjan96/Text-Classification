# Text-Classification
Text Classification and Visualization
The Reuter's dataset provided by Keras contains several problems. For example, the a lot of tokens are missing from the word index as shown
in the program. I have tried to get past it. Another problem is that the classes are numbered. We do not have any textual representation of the
classes and hence it becomes hard to understand the data.
The Reuter's 21578 dataset overcomes a lot of these problems. 
However as we see, the data is very much overlapping. Which explains our low accuracy.
